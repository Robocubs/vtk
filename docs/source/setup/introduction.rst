Philosophy
----------

VTK was designed with a few things in mind, inspired by `PEP 20 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_. These collectively are known as *The Zen of Python*.

#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

Contributions and uses of VTK should follow this if possible. They are like the ten commandments of the Python community.

#. Use VTK to make money.
